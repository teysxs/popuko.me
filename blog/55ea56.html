  <p class="h1">Ex Woke
  <p class="p">Takes guts to admit your wrongs. Means you're growing up. I have been an staunch ally of social justice movement for good half of my conscious life. I still firmly believe in the ideals they seemed to preach.
  <p class="p">Freedom of expression. Equality of opportunity. Justice for all. No discrimination. Open heart, open mind. Everyone is happy and shitting rainbows, gay married couples defend their marijuana plants, muslims, christians, jews, buddhists, all pray in their own corners and respect their surroundings while right around the corner a legal brothel accepts crypto payments.
  <p class="p">No one gives a shit if you to call yourself xe emperor and identify as a broken toaster as long as you do your job and live in peace with your neighborhood. Genders are equal in society, and if needed, violently unequal in bedroom behind closed doors as long as all participants consent.
  <p class="p">Utopia we seem to all yearn for. The kind of world I have been working towards. Except, was anyone besides me actually honest about intentions of their agenda?
  <p class="p">Apparently, fuck no.
  <p class="p">Actions speak louder than words, and oh god the actions <b>spoke</b>.
  <p class="p">In times of crisis, in a split second, without thinking twice, "my" people turned around and violently, with religious devotion supported all and any actions of a country that in a day has been made a bizzare open air prison for people of certain assigned gender. Trans rights magically do not count, of course, when it is not politically convenient. At the time of writing, nothing has been reversed, and no one seems to care.
  <p class="p">On the same breath, "we" rallied in support of a movement, that has a widely known wholesome tradition of dragging the corpses of queer people, tortured to death, attached to a motorcycle, through the main streets. And also practices almost strictest known gender apartheid culturally.
  <p class="p">At first, I was perplexed. The first logical explanation was that maybe people are somehow mis-, or underinformed. Maybe if I shed the light on what exactly "we" seem to back, this misunderstanding may be fixed.
  <p class="p">Then, I bargained. Reflected on myself. Tried to gaslight myself into thinking that all somehow makes sense.
  <p class="p">Wrong.
  <p class="p">The information has been met with extreme hostility and anyone who was pointing out lack of mental integrity was simply laughed at, dismissed, and chased away, likely banned for life even. People were so devoted to the cause they were ready to explode and certainly were not interested in listening to any reasoning that may be questioning their made up minds.
  <p class="p">Whatever that is, it is not something I ever subscribed to.
  <p class="p">Do I now have any slightest desire to support "the other side", that is known for building walls, and hiding tiny mustaches under the nose, instead? Also kinda hard pass.
  <p class="p">False dichotomy. Between "this" and "that" there must be something else.
  <p class="p">The journey of looking for this "else" has just officially began.
  <p class="p">Until further notice, the woke mob is now invited to eat a bag of donkey shit. Count me out. I'm done.
