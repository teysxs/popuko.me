  <p class="h1">Once I was like 11 or 12
  <p class="p">I thought of myself as a genious inventor and liked to hang out on balcony with some chemicals, mix them, experiment with electrolysis etc. With absolutely no professional environment, just stuff I find on the kitchen and the local flea market (where, surprisingly, a lot of seriously dangerous stuff could be found with some dedication).
  <p class="p">One night, I came up with the brightest idea ever. I thought, if I just take a bottle of white spirit, open the bottle and fire up a match near the bottleneck, since its vapour is flammable, the match will glow brighter...
  <p class="p">I wish I just masturbated instead of whatever the hell I was doing with my spare time then.
