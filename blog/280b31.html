  <p class="h1">The binary nature of political wings
  <p class="p">Let me drop the bomb right away. The Left and the Right will not, ever, get along, come to an agreement, or even understand each other. They are fundamentally incapable to. Then, the distinction between political right and left is strictly binary, there are no moderates and no extremes — degree of devotion is an entirely separate axis and should be assesed independently. And the last one: centrism is just as impossible as it is impossible to be simultaneously in two different places. You can't be neither left nor right if you are a human involved in society. You can claim you are, but that would be a lie. Now, let's get to elaboration.
  <p class="h3">The Dychotomy
  <p class="p">Let's dig much deeper than anyone ever before and reach the absolute core values the members of political wings hold. Usually, we focus on the average winger's views on socioeconomic issues, and if you glance at the lists of such issues, they all seem unrelated and ideas behind seem poorly structured, if at all. However, somehow, when drunk in the pub, at work, or in the comment section somewhere, people with different views meet each other and try to talk politically, it takes them exchanging no more than 2-3 sentences to develop either awkward tension, or warm symapthy towards each other.
  <p class="p">Why is so? Why the entire worldview of the person can be that precisely seen through just the way they talk, without an exchaustive questionnaire and days of correlation analysis by the team of political science experts. Your vis-a-vis at the pub may not be equipped to understand what they are feeling and why they are feeling this way, they may burble, or even shout incoherent emotional nonsence and be genuinely confused. They may even be ashamed of their confusion and question their right to even speak up afterwards, but they will <i>feel</i> it anyway. And for a good reason.
  <p class="p">The thing is, the definition of the whatever-winger very nicely boils down to their belief on what is Just. Really that's all the whole fuss is about, very simple. See, the world, a society, is a competition, no matter how you put it. You compete for a limited resources with those who also want them, undeniable. Now, in a competition there are winners, and losers, those who do well, and those who do poorly, that's just life, undeniable.
  <p class="p">Now, which competition is fair? Take running — there are relay race, and an individual sprint competition. Both are fair, in a way, they are just different sports. Relay teams don't compete with individual runners on the same track, and vice versa. Sadly, society is not a carefully crafted fair competition with clear rules and obvious winning criteria. Society is a big mess where everyone competes with everyone, for everything they care about. And when we try to bring some order into this mess, we stumple upon a choice. How do we define the rules?
  <p class="h3">The law
  <p class="p">Long story short, the right will always pick the equivalent of relay race as a way to go. As a team, here we, as virtually all the right wingers, considers an uninterrupted bloodline. The parent has a sacred right to work their entire life on something and live an inheritance to their child, then the child can work on top off that and probably improve the common deal even further, to leave the matters eventually to their child and so on.
  <p class="p">Whichever "team" will do better at whatever stuff, is a deserved winner and has every right to use their advantage as they please. This is good and this is Just. From that, we can easily derive ALL the usual right wing talking points, every single one of them.
  <p class="p">But what about the Left? Well, they always focus on fulfillment of an individual performer. They see the state of affairs where you can be born into porr family and have no realistic chances of competing with someone born into rich family no matter how hard you try or how talented you are as fundamentally cruel and unjust. This is the way I think, this is the way I see the world.
  <p class="p">Is relay race fair? Yes. Is an individual 100m sprint fair? Also, totally yes! Which model works better to describe how our society should be running? No one knows. I mean, everyone thinks they know exactly and the other way is just barbaric lunacy. That's the whole point. The left and right will never get along, it's impossible to be simultaneously left and right, as well as it's impossible to be "somewhere in between". No fucking way. We WILL be sworn enemies to the end of time. Probably.
