  <p class="h1">Anti-immigration = pro-war
  <p class="p">Say, for the sake of an argument, we have two distinct communities of people. Name them "A" and "B", for simplicity. Now let's assume they both are more or less democratic, in an obvious "democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner" kind of way. Also let's say they share a border. Like this.
  <div><img class="crap-in-dark" src="/img/935886-1.svg"></div>
  <p class="p">Now, one cannot live in society and be free from society. Some rules have to be enforced population-wise to work, there's no full individual independence, as long as people interact and have to share spaces at all, there ought to be rules and regulations.
  <p class="p">However, societies are never static, nor monolithic: with time, people may change their beliefs and habits, ideas on what is right and wrong. They may even communicate their thoughts within community and beyond, create smaller communities, and eventually, come to disagreement with existing rules.
  <p class="p">Let's give those smaller sub-communities indicators also.
  <div><img class="crap-in-dark" src="/img/935886-2.svg"></div>
  <p class="p">Now, let's evaluate our options. Assuming beliefs of the Ab are incompatible with dominant ideology of A, there are only so much we can think of.
  <ul>
    <li>Members of Ab stay silent with no way to express their true beliefs. This can work for a limited period of time, but not forever. Also if you truly wish this is how things should be, you are probably a dictator at heart. <span style="color: #bd5a1c;">=> DEAD END</span></li>
    <li>Members of Ab form a political party and try to work their way into the government of A. However, as long as they really are a minority, without recruiting a significant amount of members from the pool of A, there's no way to win enough votes for a real change to pass. <span style="color: #bd5a1c;">=> DEAD END</span>
    <li>Members of Ab may try to secede, or establish their preferred rules by force, however, this usually means getting in territorial war with A. <span style="color: #ba0000;">=> WAR
    <li>Even worse, community B may try to "help out" Ab and defend their cause. We all know what will happen next. <span style="color: #ba0000;">=> WAR
    <li>Eventually, members of Ab may pack up and leave peacefully, letting their former overlords be. <span style="color: #0bb718">=> HAPPY END
  </ul>
  <p class="p">Can we all agree that the latest outcome is the most desirable among all? However, on a limited land there should a place for these people to get out to. When everything else is occupied, and everyone else is hostile, there's nowhere to go.
  <p class="p">In our imaginary scenario there's only one place left, which is B sector. Real life is much more complicated, there's more than 193 recognized sectors like that, a lot of options to pick from.
  <p class="p">However, for that to work, B needs to accept immigrants. When no one will, the only other option is penting up a cause for war. No ostentatious external "soothing" will help in long term, only postpone.
  <p class="p">If you are against immigration, you are pro-war.
