  <p class="h1">Boredom
  <p class="p">This photo is not any less than a boredom itself embodied. It makes no sense at all, but it kept me occupied with fun meaningless activities during whole 2 days, which I am entirely grateful for, since I had absolutely nothing else better to do anyway.

  <p class="p">It all started as blatant realization that the drink I've bought out of curiosity as part of a regular grocery shopping routine looks surprisingly similar to something I would imagine magic elixir would look like in a real world.
  <p class="p">What would a sane person do in that case? Take a photo, share it with friends in DM, laugh for 2 minutes and forget, probably. You would not do anything interesting with that unless you are really fucking bored.
  <p class="p">I decided to go a little bit further. First of all, a caption for a future post. Something that implies those are mana potions, just the right amount of absurd and funny. That'll do, let's make a picture itself.
  <p class="p">Then we will need something that looks like a flask, obviously. I went to a supermarket and evaluated my options. You can use plastic mini-bottle from any portable travel set for that matter, but I thought since they are plastic, they won't look medieval and magical enough. Fail.
  <p class="p">Gladly, there are plenty of small family stores that sell various old and useless stuff where I live, so there I found cute little round flasks, advertised as "salt cellars" after only like one or two hours of wandering. They looked just right, let's move to a next step then.

  <p class="p">Sadly, the <a href="https://www.centerchem.com/Products/candurin-silver-lustre/">pigment</a> that makes the liquid look this beautiful won't remain suspended for too long. You need to shake your flask right before taking a photo, and all the regular plugs you can find within capitalism look too modern for a medieval potion, so... at least a cork plug and something to cover it with is necessary.
  <p class="p">Needless to say, my attempts to make my customly carved small cork plug seal the flask hermetically were painfully pathetic. The next big brain idea was to use modelling clay. That suprisingly succeded!

  <p class="p">Does not look like a cork plug at all, but at least you can take it places this way. Just cover it with ancient "paper and a twine" method and you are good to go.

  <p class="p">Yet.
  <p class="p">Modern paper is also too fancy, bright and overall perfect for a medieval entourage. So I went to a flea market again, hoping to find something interesting and suitable. And it was a huge luck. Found a book printed with brutal german gothic ligature (it's <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33583">L'Arrabiada by Paul Heyse</a>, by the way) that looks like it came right from those barbaric ages we are trying to simulate now.

  <p class="p">Few pages were sacrificed to a shitty cosplay god, but it was worth it.
