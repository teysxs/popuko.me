<h1 class="centered">A brief description</h1>
<p>Just to save your time in case you've got a problem with that. I'm more or less radically left-wing (no borders, no nations, burn the flags, kill the cops-kind of), which means I'm all for self-expression and enpowering the people, all of them, not just the few. 
<p>If you're a religious conservative or something like that, I respect your right to be this way, but realistically speaking, we have <a href="/img/politics.png">very few things in common</a>.
<p>At least, I understand why people can be this way and fine with that. Can only hope such degree of understanding is mutual in every particular case.
